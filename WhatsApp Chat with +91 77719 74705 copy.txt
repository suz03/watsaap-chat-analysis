Preparing the dataset, which consists of images of cats and dogs.
Building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model architecture.
Training the model using the training dataset.
Evaluating the model's performance on a separate testing dataset.
Making predictions on new images to classify them as either cats or dogs.
The model learns from the dataset to automatically identify features that distinguish between cats and dogs. After training, it can accurately classify new images into the appropriate category.
